# Variable Haptic Feedback VR Gloves

We present the development of a haptic virtual reality (VR) glove with variable force feedback, electrotactile feedback, and finger tracking using a hall effect linear encoder and closed-loop control. The proposed glove consists of a custom-made linear encoder based on hall effect sensors to measure finger positions, and a closed-loop control system to provide variable force feedback. Additionally, the glove also attempts to incorporate electrotactile feedback to simulate the sensation of touch. Results show that the proposed glove is capable of providing realistic haptic feedback to users. We hope that this capability will improve the users sense of immersion and presence in virtual environments. Or allow for more intuitive control of various robotics systems. Overall, the proposed VR glove can serve as a valuable tool for a wide range of applications, including training simulations, gaming, and teleoperation.
